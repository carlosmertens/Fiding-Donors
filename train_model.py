# PURPOSE: To employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income 
#           using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Choose the best candidate 
#           algorithm from preliminary results and optimize this algorithm to best model the 
#           data. Goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts 
#           whether an individual makes more than $50,000.
#
# USAGE: This script requires Numpy, Pandas and Scikit_Learn to be installed within the Python environment. 
# 
#   Example call:
#    python train_model.py
